    /* ===================== ASTHMA ===================== */
    asthma: `
      <h3>Asthma</h3>
      <div class="guideline-box">
DEFINITION
Inflammatory condition of the airways which result in narrowing during exacerbation causing a wheeze

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
• Increased respiratory rate
• Feeling tight chested
• Increased inhaler use
• Peak flow depends on the severity of the asthma

ASSESSMENT (QUICK)
• ABCDE, work of breathing, speaking in sentences, fatigue
• SpO₂ (compare to baseline if known)
• Auscultation: wheeze? (remember: a “silent chest” is worrying)
• Consider triggers: viral illness, allergens, poor inhaler technique/adherence
• Check if they have a personal asthma action plan / rescue pack

TREATMENT (PRIMARY CARE)
• 40mg prednisolone if wheeze chest
• Consider how much the patient has been using the inhaler
• Make clinical judgement
• Remember: most exacerbations are viral but check for clinical signs of LRTI such as:
  – Focal chest sounds
  – Reduced SpO₂
  – Fever
• Consider referring to the patient’s individual asthma plan
• Consider the patient’s last respiratory review – they may need another review

WHEN TO THINK “NOT JUST ASTHMA”
• Fever + focal chest signs → consider pneumonia
• Pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, risk factors → consider PE
• Orthopnoea, oedema, bibasal crackles → consider HF
• Sudden unilateral reduced air entry → consider pneumothorax

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE)
• Severe breathlessness / exhaustion / unable to speak
• SpO₂ low or dropping despite treatment
• Cyanosis, reduced consciousness, agitation/confusion
• “Silent chest” or very poor air movement
• Features of sepsis

    /* ===================== VIRAL URTI ===================== */
    virusrti: `
      <h3>Viral URTI</h3>
      <div class="guideline-box">
DEFINITION
Self-limiting viral infection of the upper airway (nose/throat). Antibiotics are usually not indicated.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS (COMMON)
• Runny/blocked nose
• Sore throat
• Headache
• Cough (often mild early)
• Low-grade fever
• Myalgia / fatigue

ASSESSMENT (QUICK)
• Duration + severity (impact on function, hydration)
• Red flags (see below)
• Baseline risk: frailty, immunosuppression, significant comorbidity

TREATMENT (PRIMARY CARE – SUPPORTIVE)
• Safety-net + expected course (often 7–10 days; cough can last longer)
• Fluids + rest
• Simple analgesia (paracetamol / ibuprofen if appropriate)
• Honey / warm drinks for cough (if appropriate)
• Saline nasal spray/irrigation
• Avoid antibiotics unless clear indication

WHEN TO THINK “NOT A SIMPLE URTI”
• Focal chest signs / reduced SpO₂ / fever and systemically unwell
• Pleuritic chest pain
• Increasing breathlessness
→ consider LRTI / pneumonia / PE / HF depending on context

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE)
• Severe breathlessness / respiratory distress
• SpO₂ low for patient
• Chest pain suggestive of cardiac/PE
• Haemoptysis
• Confusion / reduced consciousness
• Sepsis features

    /* ===================== ACUTE BRONCHITIS ===================== */
    bronchitis: `
      <h3>Acute Bronchitis</h3>
      <div class="guideline-box">
DEFINITION
Acute inflammation of the bronchi, usually viral, causing cough (often after an URTI). Antibiotics are usually not indicated.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
• Cough (can persist 2–3 weeks)
• Sputum can be present (does not automatically mean bacterial)
• Chest discomfort from coughing
• Wheeze can occur (especially in smokers/asthma)

ASSESSMENT (QUICK)
• Vitals: RR, HR, temp, SpO₂
• Chest exam: often widespread wheeze/rhonchi; typically no focal crackles
• Consider baseline lung disease (COPD/asthma)
• Ask: duration, haemoptysis, pleuritic pain, breathlessness

TREATMENT (PRIMARY CARE)
• Reassure + safety-net (expected duration)
• Fluids, rest, simple analgesia
• Consider bronchodilator only if significant wheeze/bronchospasm and appropriate history
• Avoid antibiotics unless clear bacterial features or high-risk per guideline

WHEN TO THINK “NOT BRONCHITIS”
• Focal chest signs + fever + systemic unwell → consider pneumonia
• Low SpO₂ or rising breathlessness → consider LRTI/COPD/HF/PE
• Pleuritic pain / risk factors → consider PE
• Sudden unilateral reduced air entry → consider pneumothorax

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE)
• SpO₂ low or dropping
• Severe breathlessness / exhaustion
• Haemoptysis (significant)
• Sepsis features
• Chest pain suggestive of ACS/PE

    /* ===================== COPD EXACERBATION ===================== */
    copd: `
      <h3>COPD Exacerbation</h3>
      <div class="guideline-box">
DEFINITION
Acute worsening of COPD symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation (often triggered by viral infection), typically with increased breathlessness and/or sputum changes.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
• Increased breathlessness
• Increased sputum volume and/or purulence
• Increased cough/wheeze
• Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance

ASSESSMENT (QUICK)
• ABCDE + work of breathing
• Vitals + SpO₂ (compare to baseline if known)
• Chest exam: wheeze, reduced air entry; check for focal crackles (pneumonia)
• Consider CO₂ retention risk in known COPD
• Ask: rescue pack? inhaler/nebuliser use? previous admissions, NIV/ICU?

TREATMENT / MANAGEMENT (PRIMARY CARE)
• Optimise bronchodilators (per local protocol / patient plan)
• Consider oral steroids and/or antibiotics if indicated (follow guideline / patient plan)
• Safety-net and arrange appropriate follow-up/review

WHEN TO THINK “NOT (OR NOT ONLY) COPD”
• Focal crackles + fever + systemic unwell → consider pneumonia
• New unilateral pleuritic pain + sudden SOB → consider PE/pneumothorax
• Orthopnoea, oedema, bibasal crackles → consider HF

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE)
• Drowsiness, confusion, exhaustion (possible hypercapnia)
• SpO₂ persistently low despite management
• Severe respiratory distress, cyanosis
• Sepsis features
• New arrhythmia / chest pain

DEFINITION
Infection of lung parenchyma causing inflammation and consolidation. Can be community-acquired; severity varies widely.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
• Fever / rigors
• Cough +/- sputum
• Pleuritic chest pain
• Breathlessness
• Focal crackles / bronchial breathing
• Confusion in older adults can be a key presenting feature

ASSESSMENT (QUICK)
• Vitals + SpO₂
• Chest exam: focal findings?
• Consider sepsis screen / NEWS2 style approach (as per service)
• Risk factors: frailty, immunosuppression, aspiration risk, comorbidities
• Consider differential: PE, HF, asthma/COPD exacerbation

MANAGEMENT (PRIMARY CARE)
• If mild and appropriate for community: follow guideline for antibiotics/analgesia/safety-net
• Encourage fluids + rest, treat fever/pain
• Safety-net: worsening breathlessness, persistent fever, confusion, low SpO₂, inability to maintain oral intake
• Arrange follow-up/review as appropriate

WHEN TO THINK “NOT PNEUMONIA”
• Sudden onset pleuritic pain + tachycardia + risk factors → consider PE
• Orthopnoea + oedema + bibasal crackles → consider HF
• Unilateral sudden reduced air entry → consider pneumothorax

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE)
• SpO₂ low, respiratory distress
• Sepsis features
• Hypotension, confusion, exhaustion

DEFINITION
Thrombus in pulmonary arterial circulation causing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Can be life-threatening.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
• Sudden breathlessness
• Pleuritic chest pain
• Tachycardia
• Cough +/- haemoptysis

• Look for DVT signs (unilateral leg swelling/pain)
• Consider differential: pneumonia, pneumothorax, ACS, asthma/COPD, HF

MANAGEMENT (PRIMARY CARE)
• If suspected and unwell: urgent escalation (same-day emergency assessment)
• Avoid delay where red flags present
• Follow local pathway for suspected PE (Wells/PERC etc where applicable within service)

WHEN TO THINK “NOT PE”
• Fever + focal crackles → pneumonia
• Sudden unilateral reduced air entry → pneumothorax
• Orthopnoea + oedema → HF

RED FLAGS (ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY)
• Haemodynamic instability / hypotension
• Syncope, severe hypoxia

    pneumothorax: `
      <h3>Pneumothorax</h3>

• Provide oxygen/support as per local protocol if hypoxic
• Escalate early if unstable or suspected tension

WHEN TO THINK “NOT PNEUMOTHORAX”
• Fever + focal crackles → pneumonia
• Risk factors + DVT signs + sudden SOB → PE
• Wheeze predominant + known asthma → asthma

RED FLAGS (TENSION / UNSTABLE → EMERGENCY)
• Severe respiratory distress
• Hypotension, shock
• Tracheal deviation (late sign)
• Marked tachycardia
• SpO₂ very low / rapidly worsening
• Reduced consciousness
